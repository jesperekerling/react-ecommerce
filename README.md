# React Ecommerce Mockup

This is a ecommoerce mockup in React/Vite + Tailwind and some other extension.
It is also a part of my JavaScript 2 course in my Front End Developer studies at KYH (kyh.se).
This app is built connected to our teachers Vercel App. So the API might stop working in the future.

In this project we are building a ecommerce website with these features:
- Product listing
- Product page
- Shopping Cart +/-
- Checkout page
- Category listing
- Contact us page with form + feedback after submission
- Register
- Log in
- Logged in : List user orders
- Logged in Page is restricted to only logged in user
