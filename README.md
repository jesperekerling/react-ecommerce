# React Ecommerce

This is a ecommerce Front End in React/Tailwind/Vite. It works with my other Github project that is a Ecommerce API.
It is also a part of my JavaScript 2 course in my Front End Developer studies at KYH (kyh.se).
This app is connected to the backend API which is a seperate project (check demo + documentation here: https://ecommerce-api.ekerling.com/ or Github: https://github.com/jesperekerling/ecommerce-api).

In this project we are building a ecommerce website with these features:
- Product listing
- Product page
- Shopping Cart +/-
- Checkout page
- Category listing
- Contact us page with form + feedback after submission
- Register
- Log in
- Logged in : List user orders
- Logged in Page is restricted to only logged in user
